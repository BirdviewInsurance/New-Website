                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold ">Our Story: Why Birdview Was Born</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
                Birdview Insurance was founded to address the urgent and often overwhelming challenges faced by families during medical emergencies, cross-border crises, and end-of-life arrangements. Too often, Kenyans struggle with the emotional and financial burden of securing emergency evacuation or repatriation, with no clear starting point. Our goal is to bridge this gap by offering reliable, compassionate, and professional support when it matters most.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
                By working closely with trusted medical, transport, and diplomatic partners, we ensure that no family has to navigate these critical moments alone. Our solutions are built with a deep understanding of the logistical complexities involved, allowing us to provide fast, seamless, and dignified assistance to those in need.  
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold ">Our Mission</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
                To provide accessible, affordable, and comprehensive insurance solutions to Kenyans both locally and in diaspora countries, ensuring peace of mind and financial security in times of need.
                </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold ">Our Vision</h2>
